### Advantage of design pattern:
- They are reusable in multiple projects.


- They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.


- They capture the software engineering experiences.


- They provide transparency to the design of an application.


- They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.


- Design patterns don?t guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.

### When should we use the design patterns?
- We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).

- Design patterns ease the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC by providing information based on prior hands-on experiences.

#### Categorization of design patterns:
**Basically, design patterns are categorized into two parts:**

- Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
- JEE Design Patterns.

##### Core Java Design Patterns
In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

1. Creational Design Pattern

    - Factory Pattern
    - Abstract Factory Pattern
    - Singleton Pattern
    - Prototype Pattern
    - Builder Pattern.
	
	
2. Structural Design Pattern

    - Adapter Pattern
    - Bridge Pattern
    - Composite Pattern
    - Decorator Pattern
    - Facade Pattern
    - Flyweight Pattern
    - Proxy Pattern
    
    
3. Behavioral Design Pattern

    - Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
    - Command Pattern
    - Interpreter Pattern
    - Iterator Pattern
    - Mediator Pattern
    - Memento Pattern
    - Observer Pattern
    - State Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
    - Template Pattern
    - Visitor Pattern
